Welcome to PanelFRAK, where we craft tales of the unknowable and astounding for readers across Indonesia and beyond. We are a collective of creators united by a single, driving force: a **\#PassionBeyond**.

More wonder. More imagination. More stories that challenge the mind and stir the soul.

## Our Universe

In a world filled with the everyday, we journey into the extraordinary. Our focus is on the boundless realms of science fiction and fantasy, genres that allow us to explore the biggest questions and dream up the most breathtaking worlds. From distant galaxies to realms woven from magic, our mission is to build immersive universes that feel alive, inviting you to lose yourself in their depths. We believe that Indonesian readers deserve epic stories that reflect their own spirit of creativity and curiosity.

## The Architects of Worlds

PanelFRAK is powered by a team of dedicated storytellers and artists:

* **Gibran Alfaro** \- Founder, Worldbuilder, Producer  
* **Darth Qileansi** \- Writer & Worldbuilder  
* **Farrel** \- Writer  
* **Yoga** \- Writer  
* **Kira** \- Illustrator

## Our Origin

Founded in late 2024 by Gibran Alfaro, PanelFRAK was born from a vision to create a home for the kinds of epic, genre-bending stories we wanted to read but couldn't find. We are just beginning our journey, and we invite you to join us as we fracture the panels of reality and build something new.
